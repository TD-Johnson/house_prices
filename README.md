# Housing prices EDA and regression

This is my entry to the well known Kaggle competition - House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. The aim of this project is to predict the prices of 1460 houses based on around 75 features. 

My entry consisted of using a simple ridge regression to predict house prices. Of course, there was plenty of feature engineering and data transformation to improve the accuracy of the model.
